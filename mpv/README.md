## First of all
This directory is for Windows builds of mpv.  
To use it, rename the directory name to portable_config or make a soft link, and put it into the mpv directory.

## Additional software

### VapourSynth & Python3
They are the base support for SVP4. Google them, install them, and make sure they will be in the PATH variable.

### SVP4
Since SVP4 isn't a freeware, the dll files in mpv/svp4/ are just empty files. You should place the right dlls in it.
