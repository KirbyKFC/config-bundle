# Something You Should Manually Install
## antibody
The plugin manager **(important)**  
```
curl -sfL git.io/antibody | sh -s - -b /usr/local/bin
```
else see <https://getantibody.github.io/install/>
## exa
A little better than "ls"  
To install simply use this command (in Debian)
```
apt install exa
```
